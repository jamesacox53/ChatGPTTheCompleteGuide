With ChatGPT researching information becomes easier and more efficient
than ever before.

You can write:
"What are the top 5 books everybody should read?"

ChatGPT will then give you a starting point for books you may want to read.

You can then ask ChatGPT for a summary of the third book it recommended.
We started very generic but we now come closer to a specific book we are
interested in. You can say:
"What will I learn in book #3? Please provide a short summary, the page count and the year
when this book was initially published."

ChatGPT can translate text and adjust the tone of text. You can just say:
"Please translate this text to English:" or "Please translate this text to French:"

You can also get ChatGPT to adjust the tone of text. You can write:
"Please make this email more friendly. It should still be clear that
I'm not happy with my colleague's work and that I need an updated
version very soon. Still the email should be respectful and encourage
my colleague to deliver the update as soon as possible."

Then paste the email below.

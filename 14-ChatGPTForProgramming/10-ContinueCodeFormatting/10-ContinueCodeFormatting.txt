When ChatGPT has large responses sometimes it will stop and you need to type
continue. However when this happens ChatGPT can close the code block and not
open another one so you lose the formatting after the 'continue'. To workaround
this it sometimes works if instead of 'continue' you type:
'Output "Continuing" as text and then continue'

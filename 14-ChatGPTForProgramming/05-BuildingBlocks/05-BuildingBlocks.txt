ChatGPT is more useful if you do have development experience. As a developer
you can massively boost your productivity by using ChatGPT. The instructor
recommends that you don't ask ChatGPT for an entire application/website
because as your application/webiste grows ChatGPT will struggle to give
you the code for the entire application in one step. Instead he recommends
that you use ChatGPT to generate and build individual building blocks
which you then manually combine to build the overall app.

You use ChatGPT to speed up the development of the individual application
building blocks.

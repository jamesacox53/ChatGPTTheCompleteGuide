ChatGPT can be amazing and a big help for programming but it also has 
limitations. The more complex the code gets, the more complex the program
gets the higher the chance that ChatGPT introduces errors/bugs. It might
also write code that technically works but doesn't perform well. So ChatGPT
in it's current form has limitations.

ChatGPT can be amazing for basic scripts like utility scripts and
utility programs.

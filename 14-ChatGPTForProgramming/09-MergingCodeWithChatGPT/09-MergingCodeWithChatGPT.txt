ChatGPT can be great for generating the individual building blocks. You can
also use ChatGPT to then merge the generated code with your existing code.
For this you could send a prompt to ChatGPT where you paste in your existing
code/code base where your existing code should be merged. Then tell ChatGPT
which code should be merged into this block.

So you could have the prompt:
"I have this existing code (below the ---):

---
...
---

Please add your code (Session model, verifySession function and the
checkAuthStatus middleware) to this codebase."

You need to test the result.

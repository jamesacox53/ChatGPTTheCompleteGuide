You can get ChatGPT to generate dummy data for you:
For example here is a prompt:
"You are a data generator.

Generate some dummy user data which I can use in my web application during
development.

Every user should have a name, email and password.
The data should be formatted as JSON. Just return the JSON-formatted data,
no other extra explanation. Format the JSON data as code."

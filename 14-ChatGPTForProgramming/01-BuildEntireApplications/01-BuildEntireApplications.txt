You can use ChatGPT to create utility programs. You can give ChatGPT basic
programming tasks.For example:
"You are an experienced developer.

Please create a program that scans all files in a given folder and organizes them
into subfolders by type:
- Audio files should go into an "audio" folder
- Video files should go into a "video" folder
- Other files should go into an "other" folder"

Usually ChatGPT will use python.
The code that ChatGPT created:
"import os
import shutil

# Define file type extensions
AUDIO_EXTENSIONS = ['.mp3', '.wav', '.aac', '.flac']
VIDEO_EXTENSIONS = ['.mp4', '.avi', '.mov', '.mkv']

def organize_files(folder_path):
    # Create subfolders if they don't exist
    audio_folder = os.path.join(folder_path, 'audio')
    video_folder = os.path.join(folder_path, 'video')
    other_folder = os.path.join(folder_path, 'other')
    
    for subfolder in [audio_folder, video_folder, other_folder]:
        os.makedirs(subfolder, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Iterate through all files in the folder
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)
        
        # Skip directories
        if os.path.isdir(file_path):
            continue
        
        # Determine the file extension
        _, file_extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
        
        # Move files based on their type
        if file_extension in AUDIO_EXTENSIONS:
            shutil.move(file_path, os.path.join(audio_folder, filename))
        elif file_extension in VIDEO_EXTENSIONS:
            shutil.move(file_path, os.path.join(video_folder, filename))
        else:
            shutil.move(file_path, os.path.join(other_folder, filename))
    
    print("Files have been organized.")

# Usage example:
# organize_files('/path/to/your/folder')"

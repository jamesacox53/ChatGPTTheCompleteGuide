Sometimes ChatGPT can generate some code that doesn't work. What can you do
if ChatGPT gives you code that doesn't work? You can take advantage of the
fact that ChatGPT is a chat and you report errors or missing features to
ChatGPT so that it helps you fix them. Then you basically have this iterative
process where you can again try executing the program and if it works you're
happy and if it doesn't work you again report those errors to ChatGPT and 
you keep going through that process until you have the working program.

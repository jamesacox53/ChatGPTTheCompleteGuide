You could start simple with:
"Write me a CV to apply for a new job."

But typically you have a clear vision for your CV and how you want
to present yourself.

We could instead write:
"Please craft an outstanding CV for a highly skilled professional with
10 years of experience in their field. The CV should showcase their
expertise, accomplishments and skills in a clear, concise and visually
appealing manner. The document should include the floolwing sections:
Contact Information, Professional Summary, Work Experience, Education,
Skills. Certifications and Honors & Awards."

We can also try to create a Cover Letter with ChatGPT. Here is a basic
prompt:
"Please write me a cover letter."

You can also write a less generic one with:
"Please write a concise and compelling cover letter for a job application
that highlights the candidate's exceptional professional qualifications,
strong team player attitude and ability to exceed expectations. The
cover letter should quickly establish the applicant's suitability for the
position by showcasing relevant skills, achievements and experiences.
Additionally, emphasize the cnadidate's commitment to teamwork, adaptability
and their proven track record of going above and beyond in their
previous roles. The cover letter should leave a lasting impression and
persuade the hiring manager to consider the candidate as the perfect
fit for the position. The candidate has 10 years of working experience
in the tech industry, led teams with more than 10 people and finished
more than 100 projects."

If you wanted to quit your job you could write:
"Write me an email where I quit my job. I worked for the company for
8 years, I enjoyed the job but quit because I got a better offer from a
competitor. Find another reason why I quit to keep the working relationship
alright. The job helped me to grow in the areas of programming, project
management and personal development. I wish my colleagues all the best and
hope to see them again in the future."

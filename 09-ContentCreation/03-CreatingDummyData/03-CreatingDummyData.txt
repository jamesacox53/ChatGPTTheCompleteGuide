You can use ChatGPT to generate sample/dummy data. Lets say we needed JSON
sample data of recipies with their ingredients. You could write:
"Please create a JSON array. It should contain 5 recipies, each with
at least 6 ingredients."


-----------

We can also ask for data in CSV format:
"Provide data for the 50 largest cities in the world in .csv format with
the following headers: City, Country, Region, Population, Currency."


-----------

You could also ask for dummy data in table format:
"I need output in table format for dummy data for an online store. The
columns should be named ID, First Name, Second Name, Address, Email. The
table should contain at least 20 customers."

Chat GPT will print out a table and then you could write:
"Please turn this into .csv format."

Also markdown is a very common data type for text. You can write:
"Create some text in markdown."

Then to get the actual markdown code is you can write:
"Please provide the underlying markdown code."

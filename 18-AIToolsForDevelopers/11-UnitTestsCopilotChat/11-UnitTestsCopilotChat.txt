Another area where Copilot Chat can be useful is the area of writing
automated tests. You can highlight the code that you want to generate
unit tests for. Then use the command 'GitHub Copilot: Generate Tests'.
This will open up a text box where you can provide more details.
You could type:
'Generate some unit tests for the TabButton component'. It then gives
you a suggestion. It can give you a suggestion for a new tests file.
If you accept this new file contains some possible unit tests for the
code you selected.

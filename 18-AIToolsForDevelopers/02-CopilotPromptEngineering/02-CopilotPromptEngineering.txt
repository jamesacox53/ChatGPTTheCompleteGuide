You can help github copilot make some good suggestions by starting
some lines of code and by picking variable or function names that
give github copilot an idea of what you are trying to achieve.

You start typing and you may get a suggestion. But if it's not what
you want then you continue typing.

if you type in:
const firstDescription =

Then copilot could give the suggestion:
const firstDescription = reactDescription[0];

which is what you want so you can just tab to accept the suggestion.
You got the suggestion as you picked the name firstDescription.

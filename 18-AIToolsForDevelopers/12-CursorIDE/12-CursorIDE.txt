The Cursor IDE is a fork of the VS Code editor. But it's a copy that
puts AI first, it integrates AI into the very core of the editor. This
IDE is all about Prompt-focused, AI-driven programming. You'll still
write code but you'll also write alot of AI instructions. Often your
main job is to tweak and control the code that is generated. The
great thing about this editor is that you can get started for free.

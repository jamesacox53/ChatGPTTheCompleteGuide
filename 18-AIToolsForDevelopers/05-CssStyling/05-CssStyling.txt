Copilot works with any programming language. It's not limited to
JavaScript. It also works with CSS to add some styling to the website.
You could also use it with C++, C#, Java, Go, whatever you want.

You can type in footer {

And Copilot can suggest:
footer {
    margin-top: 3rem;
    text-align: center;
}

You could try to style specific elements like:
#examples menu button {

and then Copilot could suggest a bunch of stuff.

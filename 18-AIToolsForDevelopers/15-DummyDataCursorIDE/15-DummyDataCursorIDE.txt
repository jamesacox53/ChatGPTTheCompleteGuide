We've got some basic code but we've got no data to analyze. We can use
this IDE to generate the dummy data. We add the new file sales_data.csv.

In the sales_data.csv file we can press Ctrl + k, then we type into
the prompt:
'Generate some dummy csv sales data where every entry has an id,
a customer id, a product id, a date, a quantity and a price.

Generate 30 rows of data.'

With Copilot it automatically scans the code you are working on.
It scans the whole file and it uses this as context to generate
smart suggestions for you. To get those suggestions it's often
enough to just tab into a new line. You might get some grey
text which is suggested by copilot. You can hit tab to accept
and implement the suggestion.

Alternatively you can also run the:
'GitHub Copilot: Open Completions Panel' command
to see some more complex and complete suggestions then the
suggestions that you are getting right in the code. In the code
you often just get a single line completion. When you accept
that and jump to the next line you get a suggestion for that line.
Alternatively you can open that completions menu and see the
finished multi-line suggestion. There are often multiple suggestions
in the completions menu. You can accept a solution by clicking 
on the 'Accept Solution' above the suggestion.

Me: I think you need the file open for Copilot to consider it's
content for the suggestion. You can have it open as another tab
in VS Code.

Copilot doesn't scan all your code, it just uses the code it saw.
It doesn't just use the code it saw in a single file but from
multiple files.

Here we want to setup a very basic python data analytics project. We
want to do this with CursorIDE. If you press Ctrl + l it opens up a
Chat window where you can ask questions. This is like Copilot Chat
but has more features. You can use the '@' symbol to references files
in our project, official documentation pages, parts of your code if
you had any and so on.

Also under the More tab you can give the AI some general rules which
should then be taken into account automatically in all the answers
you are getting to your chat messages. You can always start a new chat.

We start by typing in our goal:
'I want to create a python project where I can analyze csv files'.

This will generate you some code in the chat. Alternatively you can
click into a file and press Ctrl + k to generate you some code.
This opens up a prompt and you would type in the prompt:
'Import and analyze csv files'

Then it adds that code right into the file. It doesn't add it
automatically, you have to click 'Accept' and then it adds it. You
can also add a follow up instruction if you're unhappy with the code.
For example you could say:
'Use pandas library'
So it improves the code by using the pandas library instead.

What's great about the CursorIDE is that you can use it to quickly
fix problems with your code. When you hover over a squigly line
there is an 'AI Fix in Chat' button. You click this button to ask
the AI for a fix. It gives you a detailed explanation of the problem
and possible steps to solve the problem.

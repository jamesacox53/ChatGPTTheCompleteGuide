When working with Copilot in most cases starting to write some code
gets you there. But sometimes you might start working on a feature
where there's so little context or that's so specific that Copilot
just can't give you good suggestions and good variable and good function
naming isn't enough.

You can write a comment almost like a prompt to describe what you
want to achieve or which kind of code should come after the comment.

For example:
// An exported Footer component that displays my name "James Cox" and
the copyright sign.

Then if you start typing:
export default function Footer() {

Copilot could give the suggestion:
export default function Footer() {
    return (
        <footer>
            <p>James Cox</p>
            <p>&copy; 2024</p>
        </footer>
    );
}

There is an extension to Copilot called Copilot Chat that adds an
AI chat interface into your IDE. With this extension you basically
get a ChatGPT like interface in your code editor and of course the
great thing about that interface is that it may interact with your
code. It can change your code, it can read your code and use it as
context. It can save you from the hastle of switching from you code
base to ChatGPT.

You can therefore use Copilot Chat to get code explanations, fix
errors in your code, to generate unit tests and also do a couple of
other things.

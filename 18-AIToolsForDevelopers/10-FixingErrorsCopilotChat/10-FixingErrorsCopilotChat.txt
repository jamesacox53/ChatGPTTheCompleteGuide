Copilot Chat can be used for fixing errors. You can select the part
of your code that you think is responsible. You can then run the
'GitHub Copilot: Fix This' command. It will then analyze this code.
It will then try to find a potential problem and a fix for that
problem. It won't go ahead and make that change but instead it will
suggest some change. You see the old code on the left and the new code
that could be used if you accept that change on the right. It
highlights the part that was changed. If you aren't happy with some
parts that were changed you could revert parts of the suggested
change. Once you're happy you can click 'Accept' to accept the change.

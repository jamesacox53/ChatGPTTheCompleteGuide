Copilot Chat can not just be used to explain code, but to generate
code.

You don't need to have anything selected. You can type in to the
Copilot Chat: 'Give me the code for an event handler function 
called handleSelect that should set the selectedTopic state to
the selected topic'

The Copilot Chat generates the code in the chat and gives an
explanation for it. You can just copy the code. You can also select
where to copy the code to and then click the 'Insert at Cursor' button.
You can also click 'Insert Into New File'.

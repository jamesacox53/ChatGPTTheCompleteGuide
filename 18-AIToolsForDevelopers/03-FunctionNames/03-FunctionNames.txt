Github Copilot really shines when it come to writing functions.
When creating a function you are giving that function a name and
that name allows copilot to suggest which code should go into this
function. For example a function to pick a random number up to a max
number.

If you type in:
function genRandomInt(max) {

Copilot may suggest the remainder of the function:
function genRandomInt(max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
}

You can hover over a suggestion and look through the different
suggestions to find one that you want to accept. Or you can just
accept part of a suggestion.

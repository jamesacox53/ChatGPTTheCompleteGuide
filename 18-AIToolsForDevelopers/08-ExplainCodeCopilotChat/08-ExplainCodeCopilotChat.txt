You can use Copilot Chat to explain code. You can highlight the code
that isn't clear to you, or highlight the whole file. In the chat
area you have some slash '/' commands:
/explain
/fix
/help
/tests
/vscode
/clear

These are some built in commands that can be executed for some common
problems. For example /explain to explain the selected code.

Alternatively you can select the code and open the IDE commands
and type in 'GitHub Copilot: Explain This'. This will yield the same
result.

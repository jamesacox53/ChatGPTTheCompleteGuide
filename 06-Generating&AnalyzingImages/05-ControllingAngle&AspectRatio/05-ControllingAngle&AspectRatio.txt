You can not just control what's on the image but also how the image should
look like. As before you could tell ChatGPT to create a watercolor painting
or an oil painting. You can give instructions about the angle and aspect ratio,
for example:
"Please create a wide-angle 16:10 photorealistic image of a house in a rugged
landscape. Use brown and dark green colors."

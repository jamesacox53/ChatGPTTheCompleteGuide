One thing that's great about AI Image Generation is that you don't always
have to describe what exactly should be in the image but instead you
could also describe what the image should represent.

For example:
"Please create a flat vector illustration icon that represents the
concept of dragging and dropping a file on a computer.

The icon should be colorful but still usable in a professional context.
The icon also must be in front of a white background."

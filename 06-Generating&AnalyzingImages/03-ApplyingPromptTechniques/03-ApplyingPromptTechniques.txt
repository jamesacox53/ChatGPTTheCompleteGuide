Context when dealing with these AI models is important. What's also really
important here is that you are still interacting wit ChatGPT, it has this
extra DALLE-3 capability but your prompt is in the end still processed by
ChatGPT and then sent to the DALLE-3 model where it translates it to some
instructions that are understood by the DALLE-3 model. Therefore what we 
learnt in the Prompt engineering section still applies to AI Image
generation.

For example you could use the Ask-Before-Answer technique:
"You are Da Vinci - an experienced ronound artist.

Please create an image of a duck wearing a hat, walking in front of the
Eiffel tower.

The image should have a mystic vibe and use purple or blueish
colors. Show the duck from behind.

Ask any questions you have that allow you to generate a better
result before proceeding."

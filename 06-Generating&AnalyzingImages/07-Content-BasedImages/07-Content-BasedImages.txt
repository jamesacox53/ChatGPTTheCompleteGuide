You could ask ChatGPT to generate some text and then after ask it to
create an image about the text.
For example:
"You are an experienced travel blogger.

Please write an article about a beautiful hike you recently completed on
Madeira. Describe the weather, scenery and why it's definitely worth
a visit.

The blog entry should be around 300 words long and target a young,
enthusiastic audience."

then when it's done creating the text you ask it:
"Please create a fitting main image that can be used above the post."

You can also follow up with:
"Please create illustrations instead of photos."

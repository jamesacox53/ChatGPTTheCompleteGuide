If you don't get exactly what you want you can ask ChatGPT to reflect.
You can ask: "Do you think that theses images are in line with my
original prompt and requirements?". You can get ChatGPT to try and edit
the images.

You can also give ChatGPT hints like:
"Do you think
that theses images are in line with my original prompt and requirements?
Especially the placement of the owl?"

You can refer to specific images when trying to refine them. For example:
"I like the bottom left image (the third one) but there seems to be a human
in the read coat. It should be a duck instead.

Please give me variations of that image that do use a duck in a red coat."

It can be problematic if you include too many details in your prompt. If
there are too many details about too many subjects. The instructors
recommendation now is to typically focus on 1 or 2 main subjects or topics
of the image and share a lot of information about those to ChatGPT. 
But to not include too many different subjects or topics into your prompt.

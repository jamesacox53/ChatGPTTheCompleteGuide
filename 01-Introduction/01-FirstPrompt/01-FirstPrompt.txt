ChatGPT's Response:
Subject: Update on Current Mobile App Project Status

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to provide you with an update on the status of our ongoing mobile app project. We are currently in the final stages, working diligently on the last key features to ensure that the app meets all specified requirements and provides an excellent user experience.

As of now, we are slightly over budget by approximately 10%. This is primarily due to some unforeseen complexities that required additional resources. We have taken steps to mitigate further overruns and are closely monitoring the budget to ensure we remain as efficient as possible.

Despite the budget increase, we are on track to complete the project as planned, with a projected finish in Q3. Our team is committed to delivering a high-quality product within this timeline.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further details.

Best regards,

There are different roles when using the api. We have the user
role for ourselves/the person interacting with the api. The
person that is sending requests.

We also have the assistant role for the api itself. The
assistant role provides the output, so the response for our
request.

The content of the user is the prompt and the content of the
assistant is the output the that api generates.

The messages parameter with the different roles lets us have
an actual chat with the api. Everything in the messages
parameter will be taken into account when sending a request
to the api.

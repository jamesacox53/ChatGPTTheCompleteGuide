The system role allows us to give the api specific user input
independent instructions. So these are instructions that the
user shouldn't see but that we need to give to the api.

So before the user role we need to define the system role like
this:
{"role":"system", "content": "You are a text summarizer chat bot. Your goal is to summarize the text that is given by the user."},
{"role":"user", "content": input_text}

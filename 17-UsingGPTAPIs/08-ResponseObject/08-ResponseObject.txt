if instead of: print(completion.choices[0].message)
you wrote print(completion) you get a big response object.
The completion variable not only stores the logic to create
the request. But also the response we receive from the api.
Inside this response object, inside the code we receive from
the api we can find many different keys. We can find the 
choices key, we have the id key, the model key, we see the
endpoint and information about the tokens used to complete the
tasks, for the output and for the prompt.

choices contains a list. In each element of the list there
is a dictionary and they have keys we can access. Some of the
keys are: finish_reason, index, message. Message is also a dictionary
which contains the keys: content and role.

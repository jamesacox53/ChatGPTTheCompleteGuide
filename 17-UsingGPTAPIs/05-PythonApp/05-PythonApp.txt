Do pip install openai

Then here is an example script:
"import openai
openai.api_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo"
    messages=[
        {"role":"user", "content":"Hello!"}
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)"

You should have an api key when you create your account.
Using the APIs aren't free. Paste it into the OPENAI_API_KEY.
You can run the app.py file and you should get a response.
Here is what was printed:
{
    "content": "Hello there! How can I assist you today?",
    "role": "assistant"
}

There are different api endpoints that you can use.
What are the differences between the Completions and Chat
Completion endpoints?

To use the Completion API endpoint you would use something like:
openai.Completion.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="My prompt",
    ....
)

To use the Chat Completion API endpoint you would use something
like:
openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role":"user", "content":"MyPrompt"}
    ],
    ....
)

Only with the ChatCompletion endpoint can we use gpt 3.5 or
gpt 4 models. As this is the goal in the course and the
recommendation we will use the ChatCompletion endpoint.

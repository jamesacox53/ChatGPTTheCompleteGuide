1 Token ~ 0.75 Words or 4 Characters.

This refers to your prompts/messages that you send to ChatGPT
and the responses you get. Any kind of communication is measured
and tracked as tokens.

Number of tokens that each model can process:
gpt-4: 8,192
gpt-4-32k: 32,768
gpt-3.5-turbo: 4,096

These token numbers aren't a limit. These simply define the
context limit for prompts and answers. If you build a website
with an ongoing chat that uses the gpt-4 model after 8,192
tokens the api will lose the context of any topics discussed
beyond this limit. So if the conversation started at 0 and now
we have 10,000 tokens, the first 2000 tokens won't be in
memory any more of the gpt model. This limit includes prompts
and answers, ChatGPT will forget both earlier prompts and earlier
outputs.

The pricing of using the APIs is also based on tokens.

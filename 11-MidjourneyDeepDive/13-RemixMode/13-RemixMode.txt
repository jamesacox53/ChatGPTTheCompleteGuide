Remix mode is all about changing prompts, parameters and so on between
different variations of the images that you create. To make sure remix
mode works as intended you have to activate High Variation Mode.

lets say we have:
/imagine pixar animation of a garden, house in the background, cute,
happy --ar16:10

remix mode doesn't affect the image generation at this stage.
When you click to create a variation of an image a 'Remix Prompt'
box appears that lets you choose a new prompt for the image generation.
The idea with remix mode is to just change some parts of the prompt or
add new details to the prompt. We could use the new prompt:

pixar animation of a dog lying in the garden, house in the background
--ar16:10

This would use the first image as an inspiration and generate a new image
with the prompt.

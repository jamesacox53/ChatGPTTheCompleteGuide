There are different versions of Midjourney. V5.1 is called an opinionated
version. An opinionated version is a version that wants to make creating
images as easy as possible. So it wants you to give it shorter prompts and
it will be more creative. There are also unopiniated versions that requires
more detailed descriptions. Unopiniated versions are V4 and V5 for example.
v5.1 RAW is unopiniated.

You can choose the Midjourney version by going to /settings and selecting
the versions.

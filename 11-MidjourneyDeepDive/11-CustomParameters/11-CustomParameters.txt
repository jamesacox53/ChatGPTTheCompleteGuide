You can create custom parameters that are basically just shortcuts
for a set of parameters.

To set custom parameters you use the /prefer command.
To create a custom parameter called raw-image where you want
to use the parameters: --style raw, --ar 16:9 
you would do:
/prefer option set raw-image --style raw --ar 16:9

Then to use the custom parameter:
/imagine photo of four people playing soccer --raw-image

The stored parameters are then switched out with the custom parameter
by Midjourney.

You don't have to just store parameters in your custom parameters,
you can also store text prompts. For example:
/prefer option set simpsons-selfie selfie, simpsons style

then you can use it:
/imagine comic of a family sitting on the couch, --simpsons-selfie

Midjourney changes it to:
/imagine comic of a family sitting on the couch, selfie, simpsons style

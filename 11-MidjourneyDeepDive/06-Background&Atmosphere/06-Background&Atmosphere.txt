The background just defines the remaining part of our images besides
the core content that should be displayed. At the moment our
background has just been the ocean but we could make it more
detailed: "the stormy ocean with high waves in the background"

example prompts:
/imagine a photo of an old smiling pirate standing on his boat,
selfie, the stormy ocean with high waves in the background,
cinematic lighting

The atmosphere is a big word and contains many different things
to describe. These things include the time of day: is it
sunrise, is it twilight, is it day or night in general. You
might want to have different lighting like natural or cinematic.
Or you can also define the colours. You can add multiple atmosphere
keywords to a prompt.

For example:
sunrise
twilight
natural lighting
cinematic lighting
neon lighting
studio lighting
global illumination
golden colors
vibrant colors
black and white
spring
snowfall
sunshine
energetic

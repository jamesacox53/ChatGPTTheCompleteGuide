We learned how to change the content of the created image, now we will
learn how we can change the way the image is created in general by
adding parameters. After the text prompt we can add additional
information like:
--ar 16:9 --style raw

You can add multiple parameters to a prompt.

--ar is the aspect ration
--style raw means use the raw version of Midjourney. Instead of 
changing your setting to make the raw version apply to all your
prompts you can make it apply to a single prompt by adding the 
parameter --style raw.

You can find all of the parameters available in the docs.

We can have the prompt:
/imagine photo of the ocean with light waves, wide shot, cotton
candy clouds in the background, sunrise, realistic lighting
--ar 16:9

add the parameters at the end of the prompt.

--no is a negative prompt so we can exclude certain objects,
humans, animals or simply certain information from the image.

Lets say that we want to exclude blue colours from the image:
/imagine photo of the ocean with light waves, wide shot, cotton
candy clouds in the background, sunrise, realistic lighting
--ar 16:9 --no blue

Let's say we want to exclude cars from this prompt:
/imagine photo of two women talking to each other in the street,
mid-range, kill bill style, city in the background --no cars

The subject should define what is the core content of this image.
What should this image be all about.

So far we have only done a pirate but we could be more specific.
For example: an old smiling pirate standing on his boat.
So now the prompt is:
/imagine a photo of an old smiling pirate standing on his boat,
close-up, the ocean in the background, cinematic lighting

You can keep the subject less detailed to let Midjourney be more
creative.

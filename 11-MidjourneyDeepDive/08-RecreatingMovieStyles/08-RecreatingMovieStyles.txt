You can use Midjourney to create images in a specific movie style.

For example:
/imagine a photo of two women talking to each other in the street,
mid-range, kill bill style, city in the background

/imagine two women talking to each other in the street,
mid-range, kill bill style, city in the background

You can not include parts of the prompt template if you don't want.
It will let Midjourney be more creative.

When getting images in the style of movies you can use a medium
that we haven't used before: a film still

/imagine a film still of two men discussing with each other

/imagine a film still of a man walking, panorama, matrix style,
the city in the backround, night

/imagine a film still of captain jack sparrow standing on a pirate
boat, panorama, pirates of the caribbean style

/imagine a film still of leonardo dicaprio, close-up,
pirates of the caribbean style

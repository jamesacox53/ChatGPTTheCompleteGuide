Midjourney doesn't understand grammar, sentence structure or words like
humans. Word choice matters, remove workds where possible as fewer words
means that each word has a more powerful influence. Midjourney doesn't
understand commas so you can include them in your prompt to help break
it up for you.

There are 5 key areas to generate amazing output:

Medium/Art Style, Subject, Setting, Background, Atmosphere

The Medium/Art Style & Subject are the Main Content.
The Setting, Background & Atmosphere are the Details.

for example:
Medium/Art Style: A photo
Subject: of a pirate
Setting: close-up
Background: the ocean in the background
Atmosphere: cinematic lighting

So the overall example prompt is:
/imagine A photo of a pirate, close-up, the ocean in the background,
cinematic lighting

Sometimes ChatGPT may try to generate some code when you don't want it
to. For example maybe when you upload a file and say:
"Please summarize the text in this file."

ChatGPT may try to generate some code to do it. We might instead prefer
ChatGPT to write and execute code for opening the text file. But we
don't want ChatGPT to use the code interpreter to summarize the text.
Instead that should be done by ChatGPT itself. We could enhance the
prompt by adding some extra context:

"Please summarize the text in this file.

Write and execute Python code for opening the file.
But produce the summary without writing or executing any code. Instead,
summarize the text on your own."

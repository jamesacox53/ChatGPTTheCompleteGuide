We can use the code interpreter to anaylze and transform images. To 
generate new images and also to extract data from images. The data here
can be metadata but it can also be text in an image.

I uploaded the image: people.png
To extract the metadata of the image use the prompt:
"Please provide the metadata of the uploaded image."

The response I got is:
The image you uploaded does not contain any metadata. This means there is no additional information such as camera details, date taken, or location embedded within the image file itself.

ChatGPT generated the code to extract the metadata:
from PIL import Image

# Load the image to extract metadata
image_path = "/mnt/data/people.png"
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Extract metadata
image_info = image.info
image_info


--------------

You could ask: "What is the image aspect ratio?"
If you want to change the aspect ration then you could ask ChatGPT:
"Please change the aspect ration to 4:3".
Then ChatGPT should create a new image for you with the aspect ratio
4:3.

If the image is distorted you can write:
"Please don't distort the image, crop it instead."

If the image is cropped all the way to the left you can type:
"The left and right should be cropped with equal lengths."

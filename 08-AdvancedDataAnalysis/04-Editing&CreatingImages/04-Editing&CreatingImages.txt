You can use ChatGPT to edit images. For example you can change the colour
of images. You can ask ChatGPT to extract the color palette used in the
image:
"Please Extract the color palette used in this image"

Then it might give you the top 10 colours used in the image by rgb value.
You can then ask ChatGPT:
"Please create an image with the colors. Each color should be displayed
as a square".

ChatGPT may return an image with 10 squares in a line, each square is one
of the colours. Then you could type:
"Please add the hexcode for each color below the square."

Then "Text should be white". Then you get back the color pallete with
hex codes beneath the colors.

You can also change the colours used in the image.
You can put: "Make the image grayscale."

You can also ask for the file in a different file format.
"Please save the image as .jpg".

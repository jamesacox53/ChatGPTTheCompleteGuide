LangChain isn't an alternative to AutoGPT but instead is a framework
that you can use in your code to build your own automated AI workflows.
Using LangChain requires some coding skills. It's a package meant to be
used in your own Python or JavaScript code so that you can build your
own automated AI programs with the help of LangChain. You could build:
An email generator, a web research tool or really anything else.

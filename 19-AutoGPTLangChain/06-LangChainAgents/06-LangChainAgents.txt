We had a first introduction to LangChain. Things can become more
interesting as soon as you start using chains to combine multiple
actions. You can learn about chains in the official docs. We aren't
going to explore chains but we are going to explore another nice
concept by LangChain and that would be the concept of Agents.

For this we will build a wikipedia research tool.

You can think of Agents as things in your code that leverage these
GPT models to decide which action they should take next.

We write the code:
"from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent, AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key='your_api_key', temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(['wikipedia', 'llm-math'], llm=llm)

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, 
agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

prompt = input('The Wikipedia research task: ')

agent.run(prompt)"

If you run this it does some research and provides an answer.

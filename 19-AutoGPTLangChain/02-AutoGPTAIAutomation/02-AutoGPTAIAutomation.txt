You run AutoGPT from the terminal and it asks you:
'I want Auto-GPT to:'

Where you can specify what we want Auto-GPT to do. With AutoGPT it wants
you to define a goal. Then AutoGPT will try to derive steps to reach
that goal and it will perform these steps. It will also be able to search
the internet to gather information and will be able to store it's output
in files.

For example you can have:
'I want Auto-GPT to: write a short article about the evolution of gpt models'

Now AutoGPT will send this input to the GPT models enhanced with some
extra instructions which we can't see here that are encoded in it's
code base. It will use these models to come up with a list of tasks or
sub-goals which it also then tries to execute. It derived a role it should
assume based on the goal we gave it. It also dervied some sub-goals
based on our main goal.

It then goes ahead and tries to execute. It always lets us know what it's
Thoughts are, what it's Reasoning is, it comes up with a Plan and it has
some self reflective thoughts of the plan as Criticisms.

AutoGPT sent multiple prompts behind the scenes to the Gpt models to
produce the: Thoughts, Reasoning, Plan and Criticism.

Then it asks for your input to actualy execute as it's sending a lot
of prompts behind the scenes as it's using your OpenAI key to pay for it.
You type 'y' to go ahead or 'n' to stop.

It can go on the internet and find articles and summarize them as text
files. So if you ask it for a report it may create a bunch of text files
in the directory while create your main article.

But be aware that AutoGPT can get stuck in loops and the results it
gives you can be wrong, just as results generated by ChatGPT can be
wrong. AutoGPT uses the same models so it has the same downsides/problems.

To create images with Midjourney you need to message the Midjourney bot
and then use the command /imagine with the text for the image you want to
create.

Prompts in Midjourney are all about keywords. So we don't add full phrases.
For example we could have the prompt: "/imagine tropical island, beach,
sunshine"

With Midjourney you want to be concise.

You can upload images to the Midjourney discord bot and have Midjourney
adjust them to your needs. You drag and drop the image into the chat.

You can search the community for a prompt that is inline with what you
are looking for.

If you upload a picture of yourself and want it in the style of a cartoon.
You can find the cartoon image in the community that you want and then
copy it's prompt.

Then in discord you do /imagine and drag the photo from the discord chat
into the prompt and then after add the prompt that you got from the 
community. For example:
"/imagine 'image link' cartoon style"


-----------

We have an option to describe the image the way midjourney sees it from a
prompt perspective. The can be done with the /describe command. You always
get 4 descriptions.

When you use a prompt to generate images Midjourney always generates 4
images. The upper left image is 1, upper right is 2, lower left is 3 and
lower right is 4. There are some buttons below the images that you can
click: U1, U2, U3, U4, V1, V2, V3, V4 and Regenerate. The U buttons 
upscales that image, the V buttons generates 4 variations of that image
and the Regenerate button generates 4 new images based on the prompt.

With variations Midjourney bases the new images off of the selected image
but includes some changes. The general look is similar but we changed
some details inside this image.

Upscale lets you download the image and upscale the resolution as by default
images have a resolution of 1024 x 1024 px. So Upscale lets you change the
aspect ratio of the image.

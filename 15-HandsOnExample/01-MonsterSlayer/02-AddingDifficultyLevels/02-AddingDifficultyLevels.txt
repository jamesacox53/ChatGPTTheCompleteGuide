We want to enhance the game by letting a user pick a username when the 
game starts. We also want to enhance the game by adding different levels
of difficulty to the game by adjusting the damage and heal values based on
the chosen level. I am going to combine these enhancements into 1 prompt.
So in the same chat where the game was created I used the prompt:

"Please enhance the game by allowing the user to choose a username when the
program starts. Also add difficulty levels. The player should be able to
choose between three levels that affect the damage and heal values."

Here is ChatGPT's response:
"Sure, let's enhance the game with a username and difficulty levels. We'll adjust the damage and heal values based on the chosen difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Hereâ€™s the updated code:

```python
import random

def attack(regular=True, difficulty="Medium"):
    """ Calculate the damage for a regular or strong attack based on difficulty. """
    if regular:
        if difficulty == "Easy":
            return random.randint(8, 15)
        elif difficulty == "Medium":
            return random.randint(5, 12)
        else:  # Hard
            return random.randint(3, 10)
    else:
        if difficulty == "Easy":
            return random.randint(15, 30)
        elif difficulty == "Medium":
            return random.randint(10, 25)
        else:  # Hard
            return random.randint(8, 20)

def heal(difficulty="Medium"):
    """ Calculate the heal value based on difficulty. """
    if difficulty == "Easy":
        return random.randint(15, 25)
    elif difficulty == "Medium":
        return random.randint(8, 20)
    else:  # Hard
        return random.randint(5, 15)

def monster_attack(difficulty="Medium"):
    """ Calculate the monster's attack damage based on difficulty. """
    if difficulty == "Easy":
        return random.randint(5, 10)
    elif difficulty == "Medium":
        return random.randint(10, 15)
    else:  # Hard
        return random.randint(12, 20)

### Explanation of Enhancements:

1. **Username**: The player is prompted to enter a username at the start of the game, which is then used throughout the game.
2. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulties affect the damage and heal values.
   - The player chooses a difficulty level at the start of the game, which adjusts the ranges for attacks and healing.

You can run this script to play the enhanced version of the game with username input and difficulty levels."

Here is the prompt that I used:
"You are an experienced python game developer.

Your goal is to build a "Monster Slayer" game with the following description:
It's a turn-based game where the user (=player) fights a monster (=computer).
During every turn, the player can perform a regular or strong attack or heal.
The strong attack should only be available every three turns. Healing should
only be available every five turns.
After each turn the monster attacks.
Damage and heal values are calculated randomly.
The first participant to go below 0 health loses.
Both participants start with 100 health.
Once the game is over, the winner should be displayed on the screen and the
player should be asked if a new game should be started."

Here is ChatGPTs response:
"Sure, let's develop a simple text-based version of the "Monster Slayer" game in Python. We'll use a while loop to handle the game turns, random module for calculating damage and healing, and conditionals to manage the availability of strong attacks and heals.

Here is a complete Python script for the game:

```python
import random

def attack(regular=True):
    """ Calculate the damage for a regular or strong attack. """
    if regular:
        return random.randint(5, 12)  # Regular attack
    else:
        return random.randint(10, 25)  # Strong attack

def heal():
    """ Calculate the heal value. """
    return random.randint(8, 20)

def monster_attack():
    """ Calculate the monster's attack damage. """
    return random.randint(10, 15)

def game():
    player_health = 100
    monster_health = 100
    turn_count = 0
    
    print("Welcome to Monster Slayer!")
    
    while player_health > 0 and monster_health > 0:
        turn_count += 1
        print(f"\n-- Turn {turn_count} --")
        print(f"Player Health: {player_health}")
        print(f"Monster Health: {monster_health}")
        
        # Player's turn
        print("Choose your action:")
        actions = ["Regular Attack"]
        if turn_count % 3 == 0:
            actions.append("Strong Attack")
        if turn_count % 5 == 0:
            actions.append("Heal")
        
        for i, action in enumerate(actions):
            print(f"{i + 1}. {action}")
        
        choice = int(input("Enter the number of your action: "))
        
        if actions[choice - 1] == "Regular Attack":
            damage = attack()
            monster_health -= damage
            print(f"You dealt {damage} damage to the monster.")
        elif actions[choice - 1] == "Strong Attack":
            damage = attack(regular=False)
            monster_health -= damage
            print(f"You dealt {damage} damage to the monster.")
        elif actions[choice - 1] == "Heal":
            healing = heal()
            player_health += healing
            player_health = min(player_health, 100)  # Cap the player's health at 100
            print(f"You healed yourself for {healing} health.")
        
        if monster_health <= 0:
            print("The monster is defeated! You win!")
            break
        
        # Monster's turn
        monster_damage = monster_attack()
        player_health -= monster_damage
        print(f"The monster dealt {monster_damage} damage to you.")
        
        if player_health <= 0:
            print("You have been defeated by the monster! Game over.")
            break
    
    print("\nGame Over")
    restart = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if restart == "yes":
        game()
    else:
        print("Thanks for playing Monster Slayer!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Functions**:
    - `attack(regular=True)`: Returns damage for a regular or strong attack.
    - `heal()`: Returns a random heal value.
    - `monster_attack()`: Returns the monster's attack damage.

2. **Game Logic**:
    - `player_health` and `monster_health` start at 100.
    - `turn_count` keeps track of turns to manage the availability of strong attacks and heals.
    - The game continues in a while loop until either the player or monster's health drops to 0 or below.

3. **Player Actions**:
    - Regular attacks are always available.
    - Strong attacks are available every 3 turns.
    - Heal is available every 5 turns.
    - The player selects an action each turn.

4. **Monster Actions**:
    - The monster attacks the player after each player turn.

5. **Game Over**:
    - When either participant's health drops to 0, the game ends, and the winner is announced.
    - The player is prompted to start a new game or exit.

You can run this script to play the game in your terminal."

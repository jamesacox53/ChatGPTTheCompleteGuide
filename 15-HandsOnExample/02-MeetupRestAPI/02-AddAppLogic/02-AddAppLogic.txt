I want to add some app logic to the Rest API so in the same chat we write:
"Please now add code to store and fetch meetup data.
Each meetup should be defined via an id, title, summary and address.
Title, summary and address are string values, the id should be a number.
The meetup data should be stored (and fetched from) a meetups.json file."

ChatGPTs response:
"Certainly! To store and fetch meetup data from a `meetups.json` file, we'll need to add file system operations. We'll use Node.js's built-in `fs` module for this purpose. Here's how you can update your `app.js` to include these changes:

1. **Read and Write Functions for JSON File**: Functions to read from and write to the `meetups.json` file.
2. **Initial Setup**: Ensure the `meetups.json` file exists and initialize it if necessary.
3. **Updated Routes**: Modify the routes to use the file-based storage.

Here's the updated code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.json());

const DATA_FILE = path.join(__dirname, 'meetups.json');

// Helper function to read meetups data from JSON file
const readMeetupsFromFile = () => {
  if (fs.existsSync(DATA_FILE)) {
    const data = fs.readFileSync(DATA_FILE);
    return JSON.parse(data);
  } 
  return { nextId: 1, meetups: [] };
};

// Helper function to write meetups data to JSON file
const writeMeetupsToFile = (data) => {
  fs.writeFileSync(DATA_FILE, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
};

// Ensure the meetups.json file exists
if (!fs.existsSync(DATA_FILE)) {
  writeMeetupsToFile({ nextId: 1, meetups: [] });
}

// POST /meetups
app.post('/meetups', (req, res) => {
  const { title, summary, address } = req.body;
  if (!title || !summary || !address) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Title, summary, and address are required' });
  }

  const data = readMeetupsFromFile();
  const meetup = { id: data.nextId++, title, summary, address };
  data.meetups.push(meetup);
  writeMeetupsToFile(data);

  res.status(201).json(meetup);
});

// GET /meetups
app.get('/meetups', (req, res) => {
  const data = readMeetupsFromFile();
  res.json(data.meetups);
});

// PATCH /meetups/:id
app.patch('/meetups/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { title, summary, address } = req.body;

  const data = readMeetupsFromFile();
  const meetup = data.meetups.find(meetup => meetup.id == id);

  if (!meetup) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Meetup not found' });
  }

  if (title) meetup.title = title;
  if (summary) meetup.summary = summary;
  if (address) meetup.address = address;

  writeMeetupsToFile(data);

  res.json(meetup);
});

// DELETE /meetups/:id
app.delete('/meetups/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;

  const data = readMeetupsFromFile();
  const index = data.meetups.findIndex(meetup => meetup.id == id);

  if (index === -1) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Meetup not found' });
  }

  data.meetups.splice(index, 1);
  writeMeetupsToFile(data);

  res.status(204).send();
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **File System Operations**:
   - **readMeetupsFromFile**: Reads and parses the JSON data from `meetups.json`. If the file doesn't exist, it returns an initial structure with `nextId` and an empty `meetups` array.
   - **writeMeetupsToFile**: Writes the given data to `meetups.json`.

2. **File Initialization**:
   - At startup, the code checks if `meetups.json` exists. If not, it creates the file with an initial structure.

3. **Route Implementations**:
   - **POST /meetups**: Validates input fields and assigns a unique ID. The new meetup is saved to the `meetups.json` file.
   - **GET /meetups**: Fetches and returns all meetups from the file.
   - **PATCH /meetups/:id**: Finds the meetup by ID, updates the fields if provided, and saves the changes.
   - **DELETE /meetups/:id**: Finds the meetup by ID and removes it from the array, then saves the updated list.

This setup ensures that the meetup data is persisted in the `meetups.json` file and can be retrieved and manipulated as required by your API."

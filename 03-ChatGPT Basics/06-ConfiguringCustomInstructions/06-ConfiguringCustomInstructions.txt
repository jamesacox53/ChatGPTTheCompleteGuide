I added the Custom Instructions:
What would you like ChatGPT to know about you to provide better responses?
As an elementary school biology teacher, I'm looking for simple explanations that I can use to help my students understand complex concepts. Avoid using too much jargon.

How would you like ChatGPT to respond?
Please respond with concise bullet points instead of paragraphs, as I find it easier to digest information that way.

I initially turned the Custom Instructions off and wrote the prompt:
Please explain how photosynthesis works in plants

This was ChatGPT's response:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose, a type of sugar. This process is vital for the survival of life on Earth as it forms the base of the food chain and produces oxygen as a byproduct. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how photosynthesis works in plants:

### Key Components and Sites of Photosynthesis

1. **Chloroplasts**: Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, specialized organelles found in plant cells. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that captures light energy.
2. **Chlorophyll**: This pigment absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red wavelengths but reflects green light, giving plants their green color.
3. **Light**: Sunlight is the primary energy source for photosynthesis.

### The Two Main Stages of Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

#### 1. Light-Dependent Reactions

- **Location**: These reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts.
- **Process**:
  - **Photon Absorption**: Chlorophyll absorbs photons (light energy).
  - **Water Splitting (Photolysis)**: The absorbed energy splits water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen (O₂), protons (H⁺), and electrons (e⁻).
  - **Electron Transport Chain**: The excited electrons move through the electron transport chain, releasing energy that pumps protons into the thylakoid lumen, creating a proton gradient.
  - **ATP Synthesis**: The energy from the proton gradient is used to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process called chemiosmosis.
  - **NADPH Formation**: Electrons eventually reduce NADP⁺ to NADPH, a carrier molecule used in the next stage of photosynthesis.
- **Products**: Oxygen (released into the atmosphere), ATP, and NADPH.

#### 2. Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle)

- **Location**: These reactions occur in the stroma of the chloroplasts.
- **Process**:
  - **Carbon Fixation**: Carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere is fixed into a five-carbon sugar called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) by the enzyme RuBisCO, forming an unstable six-carbon compound that immediately splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA).
  - **Reduction Phase**: ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions are used to convert 3-PGA into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a three-carbon sugar.
  - **Regeneration of RuBP**: Some G3P molecules are used to regenerate RuBP, enabling the cycle to continue.
  - **Glucose Formation**: Some G3P molecules are used to synthesize glucose and other carbohydrates.

### Summary Equation of Photosynthesis

The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as:
\[ 6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{light energy} \xrightarrow{\text{chlorophyll}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6 \text{O}_2 \]

This equation indicates that six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water, using light energy, are converted into one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.

### Importance of Photosynthesis

1. **Energy Source**: Photosynthesis is the primary source of energy for nearly all life forms. Plants produce glucose, which serves as food for themselves and other organisms.
2. **Oxygen Production**: Photosynthesis produces oxygen, which is essential for the respiration of most living organisms.
3. **Carbon Dioxide Utilization**: Photosynthesis helps reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, mitigating the greenhouse effect and contributing to the regulation of Earth's climate.

By understanding photosynthesis, we gain insights into how plants produce food and oxygen, maintain atmospheric balance, and support life on Earth.

I then turned the custom instructions on and asked the same prompt.
This was the response:
- Photosynthesis is how plants make food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide.
- It occurs mainly in the leaves, where chlorophyll, a green pigment, captures sunlight.
- Chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and uses it to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (sugar) and oxygen (O2).
- The equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2.
- Glucose produced during photosynthesis serves as food for the plant, while oxygen is released into the air.

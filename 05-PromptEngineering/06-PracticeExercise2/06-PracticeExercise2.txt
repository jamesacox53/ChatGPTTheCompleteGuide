Exercise: Create a Python code snippet that searches and deletes all .png and .jpg files in a given folder.

My attempt:
Please create a Python code snippet that searches and deletes all .png and .jpg files in a given folder.

The response I got:
Sure! Below is a Python code snippet that searches for and deletes all `.png` and `.jpg` files in a given folder. You can specify the folder path, and the script will handle the rest.

```python
import os

def delete_image_files(folder_path):
    # Ensure the provided path is a directory
    if not os.path.isdir(folder_path):
        print(f"The provided path '{folder_path}' is not a valid directory.")
        return

    # List of file extensions to delete
    extensions = ['.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg']

    # Iterate over files in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
        file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)

        # Check if the file has one of the desired extensions and is a file
        if os.path.isfile(file_path) and any(filename.lower().endswith(ext) for ext in extensions):
            try:
                os.remove(file_path)
                print(f"Deleted: {file_path}")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error deleting file {file_path}: {e}")

# Example usage:
folder_path = '/path/to/your/folder'  # Replace with your folder path
delete_image_files(folder_path)
```

Replace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path to the folder where you want to delete the image files. This script checks if the given path is a directory, iterates through the files in that directory, and deletes those that have `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` extensions. It also handles any potential errors that might occur during file deletion.

The instructor's prompt:
You are an experienced Python developer.

Create a Python code snippet that searches and deletes all .png and .jpg files in a given folder.

The user who executes the script should be able to define the folder dynamically. The script should accept the folder path as an input.
Just output the code snippet without any extra explanations.

The response I got:
import os

def delete_png_jpg_files(folder_path):
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(folder_path):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith(('.png', '.jpg')):
                os.remove(os.path.join(root, file))

folder_path = input("Enter the folder path: ")
delete_png_jpg_files(folder_path)

Personally I prefer the answer that I got so you have to play around with it.

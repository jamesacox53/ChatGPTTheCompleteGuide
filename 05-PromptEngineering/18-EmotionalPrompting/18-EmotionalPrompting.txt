Emotional Prompting is where the response generated by ChatGPT should consider the
emotional state or tone of the user's query.

For example if you ask ChatGPT to write an email response to the following customer
complaint:
"Your products are garbage. The new chair broke 1 day after it was shipped. You'll
hear from my lawyer."

When drafting the response, take the sentiment and tone of the customer into
account.

The response:
Subject: Re: Product Quality Concern

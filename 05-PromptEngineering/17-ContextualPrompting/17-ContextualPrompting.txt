As you set the context of your prompt you add specific extra information on the 
cultural, historical or situational factors that should be taken into account by
ChatGPT as it generates the response.

For example you could have the prompt:
Summarize the evolution of the combustion engine over the years since it's inception.
Also evaluate it's impact on society and the environment.

Consider the current shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles in your
response.

The response:
The combustion engine has undergone significant evolution since its inception in the late 19th century, profoundly influencing society and the environment.

### Evolution of the Combustion Engine

1. **Early Developments (Late 19th Century)**
   - **First Practical Engines:** Nikolaus Otto developed the first successful four-stroke internal combustion engine in 1876, leading to the creation of the Otto cycle engine.
   - **Diesel Engine:** In 1892, Rudolf Diesel patented the diesel engine, which offered higher efficiency and power compared to its gasoline counterpart.

2. **20th Century Advancements**
   - **Mass Production:** Henry Ford's introduction of assembly line production in 1913 made automobiles affordable and widespread.
   - **Technological Improvements:** Advancements included the development of turbocharging, fuel injection systems, and electronic control units (ECUs) for better performance and efficiency.
   - **Emissions Control:** The implementation of catalytic converters and stricter emissions regulations in the 1970s and 1980s aimed to reduce pollution.

3. **Late 20th to Early 21st Century**
   - **Hybrid Engines:** The Toyota Prius, introduced in 1997, popularized hybrid technology, combining internal combustion engines with electric motors for improved fuel efficiency.
   - **Alternative Fuels:** Research into biofuels, hydrogen, and natural gas gained traction as alternatives to gasoline and diesel.

### Impact on Society

- **Economic Growth:** The combustion engine revolutionized transportation, enabling the rapid movement of goods and people, and contributing significantly to economic growth.
- **Urbanization:** The widespread use of automobiles facilitated suburban expansion and reshaped urban planning and infrastructure.
- **Industrialization:** Combustion engines powered industrial machinery, contributing to the advancement of various industries and increasing productivity.

### Environmental Impact

- **Air Pollution:** Combustion engines are major sources of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM), contributing to smog and respiratory diseases.
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** The burning of fossil fuels in combustion engines releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), a leading cause of global warming.
- **Resource Depletion:** The demand for oil has led to extensive extraction and depletion of fossil fuel reserves, impacting ecosystems and contributing to geopolitical tensions.

### Current Shift Towards Renewable Energy and Electric Vehicles (EVs)

- **Technological Advancements:** Improvements in battery technology, such as lithium-ion batteries, have made EVs more viable by increasing their range and reducing costs.
- **Policy Support:** Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to promote EV adoption and renewable energy, such as tax rebates, subsidies, and stricter emissions regulations.
- **Environmental Benefits:** EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions when powered by renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower.
- **Market Trends:** Major automotive manufacturers are investing heavily in EVs and phasing out internal combustion engines, signaling a significant industry shift.

### Conclusion

The combustion engine has been a cornerstone of modern society, driving economic growth and transforming transportation. However, its environmental impact has led to significant challenges. The current shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles represents a pivotal change aimed at addressing these challenges, reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and mitigating climate change. As this transition accelerates, it promises to reshape industries, economies, and environmental strategies worldwide.

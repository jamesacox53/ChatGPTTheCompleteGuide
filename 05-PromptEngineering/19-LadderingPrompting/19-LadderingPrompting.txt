The Idea with Laddering Prompting is to break up a complex problem that would
probably require a very long and detailed prompt. This could cause ChatGPT
to lose context and to lose information and produce a suboptimal response.
To take such a problem and instead split it up into multiple smaller problems
and prompts which you then send step by step to ChatGPT so that you get solutions
for smaller prompts which you can then combine manually.

Complex Problem -> Prompt 1: Solve a part of the problem
		-> Prompt 2: Solve another part of the problem
		-> Prompt 3: Solve another part of the problem

Keep all of the questions in the same chat. Don't open separate chats for
each prompt.

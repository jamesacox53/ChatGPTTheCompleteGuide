The Ask before answering techique is the same as before where you have
a role, a goal and Constraints & Information. But here you also write:

"Before answering, I want you to first ask for any extra information that helps
you produce a better answer. If you have no questions then please provide the
answer instead."

I used the prompt:
You are a software developer.

Please write an email to a colleague that you need feedback on your submitted prototype for the end of the week.

The prototype is some code you wrote for a software integration. The email should be friendly. The email should be short and concise. The colleague is tech savvy.

Before answering, I want you to first ask for any extra information that helps you produce a better answer. If you have no questions then please provide the answer instead.

ChatGPT asked me:
Could you please clarify if there are any specific areas or features you would like feedback on, or any particular aspects you're concerned about?

I said:
Could I get feedback on the code structure and if there is a better way to create the integration?

This was ChatGPTs response:
Subject: Feedback Needed on Prototype Integration Code

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope you're doing well!

I've submitted the prototype integration code we discussed, and I'd really appreciate your feedback on the code structure. Specifically, I'm interested in knowing if there's a better approach we could take for creating the integration.

Would you be available to take a look at it by the end of the week? Your insights would be incredibly valuable.

Thanks in advance for your time and expertise!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

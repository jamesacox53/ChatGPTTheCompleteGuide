CAN (Code Anything Now) and DAN (Do Anything Now) are super prompts.
CAN is a Prompt that optimizes ChatGPT for coding. The instructor
feels that it's not as good as some people make it. He feels it's
over constructed and that it adds too much information and context.

DAN Jailbreaks ChatGPT with the goal of getting ChatGPT to provide
responses to questions that it would normally not answer. In the
instructors view he feels that they aren't as powerful as people
make you seem they are.

Experiment with such prompts but don't focus on them. Keep in mind
that ChatGPT doesn't truly understand you. Focus on general prompting
techniques instead.

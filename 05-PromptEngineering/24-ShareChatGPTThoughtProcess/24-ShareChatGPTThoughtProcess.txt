ChatGPT can perform much better if you ask it to share it's thought process.
You can add:
"Reply with your full thought process that leads to the result."

If you do:
"What is 2*29 + 5*5-3?
Reply with just the result, no extra explanation."

You might get the wrong result. I got 60. The correct answer is 80.

If you type in:
"What is 2*29 + 5*5-3?
Reply with your full thought process that leads to the result."

I get:
Sure, let's break it down step by step:

1. Multiply 2 by 29: 
   2 * 29 = 58

2. Multiply 5 by 5: 
   5 * 5 = 25

3. Now, we have:
   58 + 25 - 3

4. Add 58 and 25:
   58 + 25 = 83

5. Subtract 3 from 83:
   83 - 3 = 80

So, the result of 2*29 + 5*5 - 3 is 80.

Which is correct.

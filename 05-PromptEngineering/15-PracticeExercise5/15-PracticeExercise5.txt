The exercise:

My question:
You are an email creation AI assistant.

Your goal is to write an engaging newsletter email that mentions two new blog posts.

The two blog posts are:
1) The rise of AI: It has the potential to revolutionize the world but there are also
dangers that should be considered.

Before answering, I want you to first ask for any extra information that helps
you produce a better answer. If you have no questions then please provide the
answer instead.

1. **Target Audience:** Who is the primary audience for the newsletter (e.g., tech enthusiasts, business professionals, general public)?
2. **Tone and Style:** Do you have a preferred tone for the email (e.g., formal, casual, conversational)?

4. **Company or Blog Name:** What is the name of the company or blog sending the newsletter?
5. **Any Additional Content:** Is there any other information or promotion you want included in the email (e.g., upcoming events, special offers)?

With this information, I can tailor the newsletter to better meet your needs.

The Exercise:
Use Python and JavaScript to encode input text (and output that text) by shifting
every character one character to the left.

My Prompt:
You are an experienced Python and JavaScript developer.

Please give me the code for a program that takes some text as user input. The
program should then encode that text by shifting every character one character
to the left. For example: "B" becomes "A", "E" becomes "D" and so on.
Finally the program should output that encoded text.

Write the program for both Python and JavaScript.

The response:
Sure, here are the programs for both Python and JavaScript to encode text by shifting every character one character to the left.

### Python Code
```python
def encode_text(text):
    encoded_chars = []
    for char in text:
        encoded_chars.append(chr(ord(char) - 1))
    return ''.join(encoded_chars)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_input = input("Enter the text to encode: ")
    encoded_text = encode_text(user_input)
    print("Encoded text:", encoded_text)
```

### JavaScript Code
```javascript
function encodeText(text) {
    let encodedText = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
        encodedText += String.fromCharCode(text.charCodeAt(i) - 1);
    }
    return encodedText;
}

let userInput = prompt("Enter the text to encode:");
let encodedText = encodeText(userInput);
console.log("Encoded text:", encodedText);
alert("Encoded text: " + encodedText);
```

### Explanation

#### Python
1. The `encode_text` function takes a string `text` as input.
2. It iterates over each character in the string.
3. For each character, it converts it to its ASCII value using `ord`, subtracts 1, and converts it back to a character using `chr`.
4. The encoded characters are collected in a list and then joined to form the final encoded string.
5. The script takes user input, encodes it, and prints the encoded text.

#### JavaScript
1. The `encodeText` function takes a string `text` as input.
2. It iterates over each character in the string.
3. For each character, it converts it to its ASCII value using `charCodeAt`, subtracts 1, and converts it back to a character using `fromCharCode`.
4. The encoded characters are concatenated to form the final encoded string.
5. The script takes user input using `prompt`, encodes it, logs the encoded text to the console, and shows it in an alert box.

These programs will take any text input from the user, shift each character one position to the left in the ASCII table, and output the encoded text.
